# Let's GIT started

The first thing we need to do on our git journey is to make a GitHub account.

- [ ] Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) to create an account


### GitHub CLI Setup
Next we need to setup some default information on the command line so git knows who we are.
- [ ] Setup global User Name

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

- [ ] Setup global User Email

```bash
git config --global user.email "Your Github Email"
```

Great! You're all ready to go!
